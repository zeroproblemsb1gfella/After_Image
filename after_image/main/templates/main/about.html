            <h5>What is After Image?</h5>
            <p class="lead">Content is everywhere more than ever. Sports, social media, tv, film, and vertical media are among a sea of
                products competing for our attention daily. Film is one of those mediums that requires the most attention and time.
                Because of this, social media around film has become focused primarily on ratings or how ”good” a piece of content
                is. With attention in limited supply, these ratings have become instrumental in sifting through everything to find
                something worth their time. Rotten Tomatoes is a crucial example of this, with the Tomatometer becoming a key
                indicator of a film's success. But this obsession with criticism has, in our opinion at After Image, proved detrimental
                to the viewing experience. Instead of enjoying a movie and discussing its themes, the audience's reaction is more
                attuned to the Rotten Tomatoes approach.</p>
            <p class="lead">After Image is a social media discussion platform that has ten movies highlighted each month, each with 
                different budgets, languages, mediums and time periods. Users can be part of a global film club to watch and
                discuss the same films each month. Its a place where advertising, Rotten Tomatoes and ratings matter less and where deciding
                what to watch is less tiresome.</p>
            <p class="lead">Users can log into an account, create a profile, browse through different films and read the posts and discussion threads
                associated with each film. They can contribute to the discussion, create threads, and save/favorite posts they enjoy. Film criticism 
                is still welcome but so is analysis or any sort of engagement. </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Our Mission</h5>
            <p class="lead">Our purpose with After Image is, first and foremost, to foster an online community for genuine engagement
                and love for film. Different features will be proposed, created, removed and adapted to serve that goal.</p>
