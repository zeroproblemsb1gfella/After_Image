            <p><br>Born in Wisconsin, United States, Orson Welles was a quite influential filmmaker who has a legendary
                reputation but has seen decreased conversation in the film-space. Though his precedent reputation is
                known by many, he still deserves to have a piece of fame among the countless authors every now and then
                as a form of respect and tribute to this legendary filmmaker.</p>

            <p><br>- "Our works in stone, in paint, in print, are spared, some of them, for a few decades or a
                millennium or two, but everything must finally fall in war, or wear away into the ultimate and universal
                ash - the triumphs, the frauds, the treasures and the fakes. A fact of life: we're going to die."</p>
            <p>- "Be of good heart, cry the dead artists out of the living past. Our songs will all be silenced, but
                what of it? Go on singing. Maybe a man's name doesn't matter all that much."</p>
            <p>- "Reality? It's the toothbrush, waiting at home for you in its glass. A bus ticket. A paycheck."</p>
            <p>- "I find I need something - to believe. I must believe that art, itself, is real. If it is not, Se√±or?"
