<h5>Quotes</h5>
<h7>
    Wolf: I was there to witness all of them. Each frivolous end. 
    But you didn't even notice me, because Puss in Boots laughs in 
    the face of death, right? But you're not laughing now.
</h7>
<br>
<br>
<h7>
    Puss: You are no bounty hunter. You are...
</h7>
<br>
<br>
<h7>
    Wolf: Death. And I don't mean it metaphorically or rhetorically or
    poetically or theoretically or any other fancy way. 
    I'M DEATH. STRAIGHT UP! And I've come for you, Puss in Boots.
