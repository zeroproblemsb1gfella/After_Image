                        <p class="card-text">The show was largely based on the true crime story and nonfiction book
                            written by Jon Krakauer. Detective Jeb Pyre upon the investigation of a murder of a saint
                            mother and her baby daughter that were involved in a church had caused his mind to whither.
                            The story places a lot of emphasis on the themes portrayed by religiosity and family and how
                            the mind of the detective comes to terms with the things that are keeping him afloat in his
                            mind and the things that can drift away his sanity and what possible outcomes lay for him
                            yet.</p>
